    <h2>Fated Hearts</h2>

    <h4><u>Chapter 1: The First Meeting</u></h4>
    <p>
      <b style="color: blue">Charles</b> never believed in love at first sight
      until the day he met <b style="color: pink">Kristel</b> at the
      <i>university library</i>. She was quietly reading a <u>novel</u>, her
      hair falling gently across her face as she turned the pages. Gathering his
      courage, <b style="color: blue">Charles</b> introduced himself, and to his
      surprise, <b style="color: pink">Kristel</b> welcomed his company with a
      warm smile. They talked for hours that day, sharing stories about
      <i>school</i>, dreams, and even their favorite <u>foods</u>. From that
      moment, <b style="color: blue">Charles</b> felt a spark in his heart that
      he couldn’t ignore.

    <h4><u>Chapter 2: Growing Closer</u></h4>
    <p>
      Weeks passed, and <b style="color: blue">Charles</b> and
      <b style="color: pink">Kristel</b> grew inseparable, spending time
      together between <i>classes</i> and after <i>school</i>. They laughed at
      silly jokes, supported each other during stressful <i>exams</i>, and
      shared quiet moments under the <i>campus trees</i>.
      <b style="color: blue">Charles</b> admired
      <b style="color: pink">Kristel</b>’s kindness, while
      <b style="color: pink">Kristel</b> admired
      <b style="color: blue">Charles</b>’s perseverance and determination. Their
      bond deepened as they began to realize how much they inspired each other.
      Every day felt like a new <u>chapter</u> of their own story waiting to be
      written.

    <h4><u>Chapter 3: A Promise of Forever</u></h4>
    <p>
      One evening, under the glow of the <i>stary skies</i>,
      <b style="color: blue">Charles</b> finally confessed his feelings. With
      his heart racing, he told <b style="color: pink">Kristel</b> how much she
      meant to him and how he wanted to be by her side forever.
      <b style="color: pink">Kristel</b>’s eyes shimmered as she softly replied
      that she felt the same way from the very beginning. They held
      <u>hands</u>, promising to support, love, and grow together no matter what
      challenges came their way. In that moment,
      <b style="color: blue">Charles</b> and
      <b style="color: pink">Kristel</b> knew their love story was just
      beginning, destined to last a lifetime.
